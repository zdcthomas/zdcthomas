# Hey!
### I'm Zach
I'm a developer.

The repos that I've made that I'm proud of are the things that were the most fun to build.
* [Dmux](https://github.com/zdcthomas/dmux) is a workspace manager for tmux (and probably the most widely used thing I've made).
* [Toskr](https://github.com/zdcthomas/Toskr) is an older attempt at an elixir message handler for [Nats](https://nats.io/)
* [My dotfiles](https://github.com/zdcthomas/yakko_wakko), because it's fun to trim the hedges.
